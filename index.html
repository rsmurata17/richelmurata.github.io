<h2>🧪 Engineering & Science</h2>
<p>I like building things that probably <em>shouldn’t</em> work—but do. I’ve worked on surgical robots at Stryker, examined material failures at Apple, and explored catalytic systems in chemistry labs. Whether I’m prototyping devices or running experiments, I love chasing the “why” behind how things break, move, and react.</p>

  <h2>🎨 Art & Design</h2>
<p>When I’m not prototyping in the lab, I’m designing. I love bringing ideas to life through product sketching, Figma mockups, and the full Adobe chaos suite.</p>
